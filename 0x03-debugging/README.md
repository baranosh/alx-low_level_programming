The term debugging can mean a lot of different things, but most literally, it means removing bugs from your code.
What are bugs in program?
In simple terms, a bug can be defined as an error in a program. During the coding of a program, we often make some mistakes. These mistakes showcase themselves as bugs in your code.

Debugging is the process of locating and fixing bugs in computer program code. To debug a program is to start with a faulty piece of code, isolate the sources of any problems, and then fix them.
