#     Learning to code with C language

##    Why to learn C Programming Language?

   - C Language has been one of the most extensively used and favored programming languages since its inception.
   - C enables you to understand a computer's fundamental design, as well as how it stores and retrieves data.
   - Learning C will eventually help in understanding the concepts of other programming languages like Java, Python, etc. faster.
   - You can start working on open-source projects as C is used in some of the greatest open-source projects, such as in the making of Linux Kernel Software, Libraries of Python, Databases like SQLite, etc.

##    What is C Programming Language?

The C Programming Language is a procedural-oriented programming language. It was invented by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It was designed specifically as a System Programming Language for the development of various operating systems. Low-level memory access, a small collection of keywords, and a straightforward style make the C Language ideal for system programming, such as compiler and kernel development.

##    C as a Mother Language

C programming language has inspired the creation of many other languages like `C++` (also known as C with classes), `C#`, `Python`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Perl`, `PHP`, and others. Every programming language uses the C programming language to varying degrees. Python, for example, uses C for creating its standard libraries, whereas `C++`, `PHP`, and `Perl` need `C` for their syntaxes and control structures and that is why it is also commonly referred to as the "mother of all programming languages".

##    C as a System Programming Language

C Language is known as a system programming language because it is compatible with low-level programming. It is commonly used to create operating systems, hardware devices, drivers, kernels, and system software such as the Linux Kernel Software is written in C.

##    C as a Procedural Programming Language

C is referred to as a procedural programming language because it employs a set of instructions to teach the computer what to do step by step. It relies on the procedures or the routines.

##    C as a Structured Programming Language

C acts as a Structured Programming Language because we can divide our program into pieces using functions to simplify the program's comprehension and modification. It is a subset of the Procedural Programming Language.

##    C as a Mid-Level Programming Language

C Language is classified as a Middle-Level Programming language because it is close to both machines (low-level) and humans (high-level). The C language program is translated into assembly code, which enables low-level pointer arithmetic and it is machine independent that is a property of high-level languages.

##    What are the types of C Programs?

Programs in C can be of many types, these are as listed below:

   1. Simple Input/Output
   2. Functional Programs
   3. Pointers based
   4. Array-based
   5. Structures based
   6. Files Handling etc.

##    Facts about the C Programming Language

   - C is the only programming language that has been around for so long and is still frequently used.
   - `UNIX OS` is completely written in C and it was the first operating system kernel that was written in a non-assembly language.
   - C is the replacement for the B programming language, which was first presented in the early 1970s.
   - `C18` is the most recent version of the C language, which was released in June of 2018.
   
##    Applications of C Programming Language

C is used to create embedded software and firmware for a variety of micro-controller-based electronics, industrial, and communications equipment. C was originally used for software development, namely for the programs that make up an operating system. C can have a variety of applications, for example, in :

   - Operating Systems
   - Compilers
   - Interpreters
   - Assemblers
   - Text Editors
   - Drivers
   - Databases, etc.
