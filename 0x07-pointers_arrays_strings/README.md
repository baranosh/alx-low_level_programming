# 0x07 EVEN POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS

	## TASK 0
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

- Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s

	## TASK 1
- Write a function that copies memory area.

- Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
- The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
- Returns a pointer to dest
