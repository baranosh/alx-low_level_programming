POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS IN C

TASK 0: Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

TASK 1 Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

TASK 2: Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

TASK 3: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

TASK 4: Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

TASK 5: Write a function that reverses a string.

Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

TASK 6: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

TASK 7: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
The function should print the second half of the string
If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

TASK 8: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
You are allowed to use printf

TASK 9: Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

Return value: the pointer to dest

TASK 10: Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);
The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.

TASK 11: Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

You are allowed to use the standard library
You don’t have to pass the betty-style tests (you still need to pass the betty-doc tests)
man srand, rand, time
gdb and objdump can help
