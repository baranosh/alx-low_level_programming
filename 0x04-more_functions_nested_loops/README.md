C - MORE FUNCTIONS, MORE NESTED LOOPS

0 - Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
1 - Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2 - Write a function that multiplies two integers.
3 - Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4 - Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
5 - Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
6 - Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
7 - Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
8 - Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
9 - Fizz-Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the     multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
10 - Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.


"Dealing with more functions and loops in C. I am really loving C though."
