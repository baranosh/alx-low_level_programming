0X00. C - HELLO, WORLD

	TASK 0: Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output should be saved in the file c

	TASK 1: Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o

	TASK 2: Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s

	TASK 3: Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

	TASK 4: Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function puts

Your program should return 0
You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option

	TASK 7: Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
